#Beams v0.1.3 (Beta)

Beams is an open framework for building media websites, including news sites, blogs, video apps, et cetera. 

###Features

Beams v0.1.2 is a beta release with the following features:

- **Node.js/Express Web server.** A simple, fast server script to get your project up and running quickly. A basic website file structure is also included for serving static pages of content.

- **Ultraresponsive layout.** Layout is based on a 20-column, 4,000-pixel grid. This allows elegant resizing of elements on any size screen, from a large TV down to a smartphone. Video players are also responsive, including support for embedded players for YouTube, Vimeo, and self-hosted HTML5 video.

- **Default typefaces from Google Fonts.** We use Merriweather for headlines and Open Sans for pretty much everything else. (Of course, implementers should feel free to change these to something else if your project requires.)

- **jQuery 2.1.3.** The framework's `beams-client.js` file includes a full, minified copy of this popular JavaScript library so your project can quickly call functions from it.

###Requirements

To implement Beams, you'll need a computer to use as a server that has the following software installed.

- **Node.js 0.10.26 or later.** Popular server-side JavaScript platform that uses Google's V8 engine.

- **npm 1.4.3 or later.** The node package manager. Helps add modules that enhance functionality of the stock version of Node.js. 

- **Express 4.10.4 or later.** Add-on Node.js module for building full-featured Web apps.

- **Forever 0.10.11 or later.** Add-on Node.js module that keeps the server running persistently.
